Team Name: Something Something Danger Zone
Final Project - The Grand (Re)Opening!

Description: This program allows you to fly a cute propellor plane around the scenic Arizona desert. View the low-resolution 
world from the sky and watch your adorable aircraft climb high into the atmosphere. Watch the propellor spin around
at dizzying speeds, and see how the wing flaps will react to climbinb and falling.The sun will
illuminate the tepid sand until it is eventually replaced in a cruel twist of fate by the grace of the moon herself. 
The user can watch as objects far in the distance fade to match the hazy horizon with a seductive fragment shader.

Usage: The WASD keys can be used to change the orientation of the UAV, and holding down the space bar will move the UAV forward 
in the direction it is facing. Pressing 1 switches between a 1st and 3rd person camera. Q and ESC will exit the program. 

Compiling: To run the program, make sure that the include paths are correct in CMakeLists.txt. If running from CLion, make sure that glew.dll
is in both the main project folder and cmake-build-debug, and set the project path to the main project folder. 

There is no input configuration file that the program reads.

Bugs: Flying is bit wonky.

Distribution of responsibilities:
Nathan - Set up github repo, found and loaded the skybox and all the models, positioned models, animated propeller, documentation
Eric - Did day/night lighting cycle, texturing on plane, debugging, 
Alex - object movement, camera views, UAV animation, 
David - Fog, generated ground with new textures, 

This assignment took us about about 30 hours between the 4 of us

Labs: 3/10. Some helped but it's a final, open-ended project.

This assignment was 6/10
